# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: The Difference between a parameter and an argument is that, a parameter is a listed name in a function. An argument is  value that passes to the function.

Researched answer:
Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:  Javascript takes in two  predefined parameters which are considered the arrays, which are great for simplyfining code.

Researched answer: 
map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. map() calls a function once for each element in an array. map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does not change the original array.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:   A map returns an array and a filter filters the code to find the specific answer or question you want. 

Researched answer:
Map: returns an array of pieces of information from the original array. In the callback function, return the data you wish to be part of the new array. Filter: returns a subset of the original array based on custom criteria.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: an iteration is a method of coding when you want to execute code individually for each item in a collection.

Researched answer:
Iteration occurs when we want to execute code once for each item in a collection, usually elements in an array or properties of an object.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: A function would be considered the start of a code that let's you know which direction you would be starting. 

Researched answer:

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. The javascript method is an object property that has a function value. A function can pass the data that is operated and may return the data. The method operates the data contained in a Class.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:  Hoisting is when you move the declaration of the variables and function to the top. 

Researched answer:

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.
